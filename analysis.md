## Layer 2, Head 7

This attention head appears to focus on the relationship between determiners and the nouns they modify. In multiple sentences, determiners such as "the", "a", and "my" attend strongly to the noun that immediately follows them. This suggests that the head has learned to associate determiners with the nouns they introduce, which is an important part of understanding noun phrases.

Example Sentences:
- "The cat sat on the [MASK]."
- "She opened a [MASK] slowly."

In both cases, the determiner ("the", "a") shows high attention weights toward the noun token, indicating a determiner–noun dependency.


## Layer 6, Head 3

This attention head appears to focus on the relationship between pronouns and the verbs they are associated with. Pronouns such as "he", "she", and "they" tend to attend strongly to the verb that describes their action. This suggests the head has learned a subject–verb relationship, which is critical for understanding sentence structure.

Example Sentences:
- "He quickly [MASK] the door."
- "They [MASK] across the field."

In these examples, pronouns consistently show stronger attention to the main verb of the sentence, indicating that this attention head captures grammatical subject–verb relationships.
